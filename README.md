# Problem Statement
Predictive Analytics in Healthcare: Develop predictive analytics solutions that can forecast potential conditions for the individual that could result in hospitalization. Choose a specific health condition and develop a solution that would leverage analytics to help the care given in the family anticipate upcoming tasks better. Could you also help the care providers such as doctors & nurses with insights that would help cater to the upcoming needs of a sick person? Apply modern day conveniences such as smartphones, always connected Systems and data sciences to formulate new solutions.

# Proposed Solution
In order to solve this problem we are developing an easily-accessible online-platform. The platform would form a collaborative community of professionals and caretakers.

In this community, each user (professionals/caretakers) can add their experience treating a particular symptom or disease. Thus, providing the community with helpful data.

When a particular user would like to refer to solutions regarding treating a symptom, all they have to do is provide details regarding the symptom ( eg: duration, age of the patient, severe/not severe ). Using existing data, our platform should be able to recommend diagnosis for the patient and provide evidence for the same.

Also, if a particular diagnosis provides to be useful, the user can upvote/rate it. This should help the platform generate more useful recommendations and discard bad recommendations.

# Use cases
* User registration
* User login
* Users can add experience treating a    symptom/disease
* Users can look for diagnosis for a particular symptom.
* Users can upvote/downvote a diagnosis already present regarding their usefulness.

# Technology Stack
* Front-end: React.JS, Material UI
* Backend: Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL
